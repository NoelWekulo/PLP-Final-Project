With approximately one-third of all food produced for human consumption being lost or wasted each year, and millions suffering from hunger and food insecurity, It aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform for easy donation and distribution of excess food items and other items available for donations. By leveraging technology and community participation, Zero_hunger_App strives to reduce food waste, alleviate hunger, promote sustainability, and foster community engagement.
